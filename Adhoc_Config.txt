****Windows-Configuration****
1.Open Command Prompt and type
	netsh wlan show driver
2. Check if your hosted network supported option : Yes. If it says No, find a driver and download it.
3. Go to Network and Sharing center->Set-up Manually-->Enter SSID ("vehicleAdhoc") and leave the rest as is.
4. Now in command prompt set up
	netsh wlan set profileparameter name="vehicleAdhoc" connectiontype=ibss
-->it should say updated successfully. 
5.Now connect to adhoc network as follows
  	netsh wlan connect "vehicleAdhoc"
6. Test the connection via a ping packet from command prompt. Also SSH into it. Adhoc-Mode is read!

**Linux-Configuration

*****On the Raspberry Pi******
1. Edit the /etc/network/interfaces {always keep a backup before editing this file}. Add the following.

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
  address 192.168.4.1  {assign in any non-conflicting subnet}
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  wireless-channel 1
  wireless-essid vehicleAdhoc
  wireless-mode ad-hoc

##
iface eth0 inet manual

iface wlan1 inet manual
  wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
##

2. For assigning ip address install :sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
3. Edit the default dhcp server as follows
       sudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
 Add the network interfaces in 
        INTERFACESv4="wlan0"
4. Now edit the dhcp.conf file
	sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
5. Uncomment "authoratitive" keyword. This is to make Rpi/dhcp server the authoratative ip distributing source.
6. Uncomment 
 subnet 192.168.4.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	range 192.168.4.150 192.168.4.170; //specify a range this is the distribution
	option domain-name and domain name-servers-->dont need to change;
	option routers 192.168.4.1;
	option broadcast-address 192.168.4.255;
	default-lease-time 600;
	max-lease-time 7200;
}
7. Reboot the Rpi before that add brcmfmac in to your /etc/modules file for availability of chipset on boot.

Disconnect from previous network. You should be able to see the "vehicleAdhoc" in the SSID list

**Connecting Multiple Pis
1. sudo iwconfig wlan1 mode ad-hoc channel 01 essid vehicleAdhoc
This connects all the adhoc modules to the ad-hoc channel


**Auto Networking**
1. Go to sudo /etc/rc.local and add the following to the interfaces (one or both)
iwconfig wlan0 mode ad-hoc essid vehicleAdhoc channel 01
